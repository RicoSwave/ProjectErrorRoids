ErrorRoids is an action game where you control a program debugger to destroy errors in your  
program. The errors appear as large ErrorRoids which must be destroyed.  Be careful!   
Destroying a large ErrorRoid causes it to split into smaller errorRoids which are harder  
to track, and will split once more to smallest syntax errorRoids before being removed.  
You will be faced with many errorRoids which will seem to increase in number constantly  
(unless you are godlike).  
Although final victory over errorRoids may not be possible,  
try to get the highest debugging score that you can!  
Good Luck!
