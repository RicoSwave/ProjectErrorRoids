Spring 2016 C335 Project


Group Members: Paul Akel & Branden Wagner

A 2 dimensional game called ErrorRoids!  In this game, youâ€™re actually controlling a computer program, represented by a cyber-space ship, through an ErrorField which represent syntax errors in the program!  

The background will be black to represent cyber space.  The space ship and lasers will be green in color, while the ErrorRoids will be various colors from an 8-bit palette.

The ship will be controllable, and the player can fire bullets at the ErrorRoids.  When an asteroid is encountered, you will navigate the ship to either avoid them, or you will use your laser blasters to destroy them.  If you collide with an asteroid you will be destroyed and a program syntax error message will appear on the screen for the player representing program failure and the end of the game. 

You will have 3 lives before the end of game is reached. The score will be kept and displayed along with an error message from the ship crash.
