Spring 2016 C335 Project


Group Members: Paul Akel & Branden Wagner

A 2 dimensional game called ErrorRoids!  In this game, you’re actually controlling a computer program, represented by a cyber-space ship, through an ErrorField which represent syntax errors in the program!  

The ship will show on screen as an Excel “X”.  The laser bolts will fire out of the top edges of the “X”.  The asteroids will be represented by ASCII symbols from the above 250 tier. The background will black to represent outer space.  The space ship will be green in color, while the ErrorRoids will be various colors from an 8-bit palette.  

When an asteroid is encountered, you will navigate the ship to either avoid them, or you will use your laser blasters to destroy them.  If you collide with an asteroid you will be destroyed and a program syntax error message will appear on the screen for the player representing program failure and the end of the game. 

You will have 3 lives before the end of game is reached. The score will be kept and displayed along with the error message.
